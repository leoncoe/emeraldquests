Explain what the force unwrap operator ! does, with an example different from the one I showed you (you can just change the type).
The force unwrap operator basically says, earlier, we were okay if it was the Type specified, OR nil, but now, we are only okay with it being the type specified.

Using this picture below, explain...

What the error message means
The computer expected just String, but got String? (which includes nil)

Why we're getting this error
We need to force unwrap to print the string because we don't want nil

How to fix it
You must append an ! to the end of thing[0x03]
