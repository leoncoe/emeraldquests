Let's play the "I Spy" game from when we were kids. I Spy 4 things wrong with this code. Please fix them.


CORRECT CODE

pub contract Test {

    pub resource Jacob {
        pub let rocks: Bool
        init() {
            self.rocks = true
        }
    }

    pub fun createJacob(): @Jacob { 
        let myJacob <- create Jacob() 
        return <- myJacob 
    }
}
